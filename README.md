# Audacious Skins Collection

Running `install.sh` should copy all of the zipped skin files into your user's
`~/.local/share/audacious/Skins` directory. This is one of the default locations
Audacious looks for skins. Make sure `unzip` is installed on your system, and
Audacious will be able to read the skin files without unzipping the individual
skin archives.
